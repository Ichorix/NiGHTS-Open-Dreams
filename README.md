# NiGHTS-Open-Dreams
Open Source NiGHTS Unity Project, cleaned up for ease of navigation.
Comes with Drag-And-Drop Player and Prefabs to build your own levels.
Original Island left as an example to show how to use the scripts.

The Unity Project is made for Editor Version 2022.1.14f1 with the Universal Render Pipeline, and has Cinemachine, TextMeshPro, Shader Graph, Visual Effect Graph, and ProBuilder already installed.
The project also comes with Sebastian Lague's [BÃ©zier Path Creator](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/b-zier-path-creator-136082), Dinopunch's [Living Birds](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/birds/living-birds-15649), NullSave's [Controller Icon Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/controller-icon-pack-128505), and BG Tools' [PlayerPrefs Editor](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/playerprefs-editor-167903) stored in the [Imported](https://github.com/Ichorix/NiGHTS-Open-Dreams/tree/0d3ee7d95afbddf83fd5990d3e7110ae56489313/NiGHTS%20Open%20Dreams/Assets/Imported) folder. Within the Imported folder, assets from various packages have been sorted into appropriate [Foliage](https://github.com/Ichorix/NiGHTS-Open-Dreams/tree/e57788342cd6cfb90495815e7add06aec4baa610/NiGHTS%20Open%20Dreams/Assets/Imported/Prefabs/!Foliage) and [Rocks](https://github.com/Ichorix/NiGHTS-Open-Dreams/tree/e57788342cd6cfb90495815e7add06aec4baa610/NiGHTS%20Open%20Dreams/Assets/Imported/Prefabs/!Rocks) folders.

These packages are
* Forst's [Conifers](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/conifers-botd-142076) + CTI URP
* ALP's [Grass Flowers Pack Free](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/nature/grass-flowers-pack-free-138810) along with some custom modifications
* Shapes' [NatureStarterKit2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/nature-starter-kit-2-52977)
* shui861wy's [Rock package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/rock-package-118182)
* Manufactura K4's [Rocks and Boulders 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/rock-and-boulders-2-6947)
* IgniteCoders' [Simple Water Shader URP](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/water/simple-water-shader-urp-191449)

Some texture assets used from [Bumper Engine](https://gamejolt.com/games/BumperEngine19GT/506351) and [Digger - Terrain caves & overhangs](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/digger-terrain-caves-overhangs-135178)

Since [Digger - Terrain caves & overhangs](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/digger-terrain-caves-overhangs-135178) is a paid package, It had to be removed from the project.
The result is that the edges of the island will look stretched now without its Triplanar terrain shaders.
Some terrain texture assets used came from the package too, but those textures orginated from DeviantArt User [AGF81](https://www.deviantart.com/agf81) and are provided with the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.

Textures used:
* [Stone Texture - 10](https://www.deviantart.com/agf81/art/Stone-Texture-10-204337154)
* [Seamless Texture 5](https://www.deviantart.com/agf81/art/Seamless-Texture-5-160257878)
